## The Preview View

The `<Camera>` React component renders a Preview view for the Camera.

### FPS

The Preview view is running at the same frame rate as the Video stream, configured by the [`fps`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#fps) prop, or 30 FPS by default.

```tsx
<Camera {...props} fps={60} />
```

### Resolution

On iOS, the Video resolution also determines the Preview resolution, so if you Camera format has a low Video resolution, your Preview will also be in low resolution:

```ts
const lowResolutionFormat = useCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: { width: 640, height: 480 } },
])
```

On Android, the Preview will always be in full HD, or the Preview View's size, whichever is smaller.

### Overlays and Masks

On Android, the Preview View supports two implementation modes which are controllable through the [`androidPreviewViewType`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#androidpreviewviewtype) prop:

- `"surface-view"`: Uses a [`SurfaceView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView) for rendering. This is more efficient and supports HDR rendering, but doesn't support masks, transparency, rotations or clipping.
- `"texture-view"`: Uses a [`TextureView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/TextureView) for rendering. This is less efficient and doesn't support HDR rendering, but supports masks, transparency, rotations and clipping.

```tsx
<Camera {...props} androidPreviewViewType="texture-view" />
```
